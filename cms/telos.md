# TELOS Framework

TELOS is my personal framework for tracking purpose and direction in life. It's a structured approach to understanding problems, defining missions, setting goals, and measuring progress.

## Problems (P)

The fundamental issues I see in the world that need addressing:

### P1: People lack meaning in their lives
- Modern society has disconnected us from purpose
- Technology often increases isolation rather than connection
- Work has become disconnected from personal values

### P2: People are stuck in outdated hierarchical mindsets
- 1950s organizational structures in a 2020s world
- Command-and-control thinking in an age of networks
- Resistance to distributed, collaborative models

### P3: Humanity is unprepared for AI transformation
- Lack of understanding about AI capabilities and limitations
- No frameworks for human-AI collaboration
- Risk of increasing inequality and displacement

## Missions (M)

My response to these problems through focused action:

### M1: Increase human Eudaimonia (flourishing)
- Create content that helps people find meaning
- Build tools that augment human capability
- Foster communities of growth and learning

### M2: Build AI-augmented systems for human benefit
- Develop frameworks like Fabric for AI augmentation
- Create accessible tools for everyone
- Focus on human-centric AI design

### M3: Create frameworks for understanding complex systems
- Simplify complexity without losing nuance
- Build mental models for modern challenges
- Share knowledge openly and freely

## Goals (G)

Specific, measurable outcomes I'm working toward:

### G1: Reach 1M people with meaningful content
- Grow Unsupervised Learning newsletter
- Create viral, educational content
- Build lasting resources

### G2: Build tools that augment human capability
- Fabric framework adoption
- Daemon personal API system
- Open source contributions

### G3: Foster critical thinking and creativity
- Educational content and courses
- Community building
- Mentorship and collaboration

## Metrics (KPIs)

How I measure progress:

- **Reach**: Newsletter subscribers, content views, tool downloads
- **Impact**: User testimonials, success stories, community growth
- **Quality**: Depth of engagement, return visitors, active users
- **Innovation**: New tools created, problems solved, frameworks developed

*TELOS is a living framework that evolves as I learn and grow. It's not about rigid adherence to a plan, but about having a north star to guide decisions and actions.*
